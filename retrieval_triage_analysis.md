# Retrieval Performance Triage Analysis

## Issue Categories & Root Causes

### ðŸŸ  **Issue 1: Query Specificity vs. Content Granularity** 

**Affected Queries:**
- Query 1: "Redis memory usage commands" (MRR=0.25)
- Query 11: "Redis full-text search index creation and querying" (MRR=0.5)

**Root Cause:** 
Query terms are **too general** compared to specific document titles. The search works but finds overly broad administrative content first.

**Evidence:**
- Query 1 returns "Redis administration (Part 4)" x3 before "MEMORY USAGE (Part 10)"
- Query 11 finds "FT.SEARCH" at rank 1 but should rank higher for the broader query

**Solutions:**
1. **Boost command-specific results** for queries containing "commands"
2. **Improve query expansion** - expand "memory usage commands" to include specific command names
3. **Adjust ranking weights** to prefer specific commands over general administration docs

---

### ðŸ”´ **Issue 2: Missing Comprehensive Topical Documents**

**Affected Queries:**
- Query 3: "Redis replication setup and configuration" (MRR=0.1) - **WORST PERFORMER**

**Root Cause:** 
**Knowledge base gap** - We have individual command docs (REPLICAOF, ROLE) but lack the comprehensive "Redis replication" topical document.

**Evidence:**
- Search for "Redis replication setup and configuration" â†’ only "Redis administration" parts
- Search for "REPLICAOF" â†’ finds REPLICAOF docs immediately
- **Missing**: Dedicated "Redis replication" comprehensive guide that should exist

**Impact:** 
- Users asking conceptual questions get fragmented command docs instead of cohesive guides
- This is the **highest priority issue** as it indicates content gaps

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify scraping completeness** - Check if "Redis replication" guide was missed during scraping
2. **Add missing topical documents** - Manual ingestion of key operational guides  
3. **Improve document discovery** - Ensure scraper finds comprehensive guides, not just command references

---

### ðŸŸ¡ **Issue 3: Document Chunking Dilution**

**Affected Queries:**
- Multiple queries showing duplicate "(Part N)" results

**Root Cause:**
**Over-chunking** of documents creates multiple similar results that compete for top rankings.

**Evidence:**
- Query 1: "Redis administration (Part 4)" appears 3x in top 5
- Query 3: "Redis administration (Part 8)" appears 3x in top 5

**Impact:**
- Reduces diversity in top results
- Multiple chunks from same document crowd out other relevant docs

**Solutions:**
1. **Deduplicate by source document** - Show max 1-2 chunks per source document in results
2. **Improve chunk merging** - Combine related chunks from same document
3. **Boost document-level relevance** over chunk-level matching

## Priority Ranking

### ðŸ”´ **Priority 1: Content Gaps (Critical)**
- **Query 3 (Redis replication)** - Indicates systematic scraping gaps
- **Action Required:** Audit and backfill missing comprehensive guides
- **Timeline:** Immediate - blocks user workflows

### ðŸŸ  **Priority 2: Query Processing (High)**  
- **Queries 1 & 11** - Semantic matching needs improvement
- **Action Required:** Implement query expansion and result re-ranking
- **Timeline:** Short-term improvement

### ðŸŸ¡ **Priority 3: Result Presentation (Medium)**
- **Chunking dilution** - Affects user experience but doesn't block functionality
- **Action Required:** Result deduplication and diversification
- **Timeline:** Medium-term optimization

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. **Content Audit & Backfill**
```bash
# Check if Redis replication guide was missed
grep -r "redis.*replication" artifacts/*/oss/ 
# Verify comprehensive guides exist for:
# - Redis replication  
# - Redis security (comprehensive)
# - Redis persistence (comprehensive)
```

### 2. **Query Enhancement**
```python
# Implement query expansion for command-related queries
def expand_command_query(query: str) -> List[str]:
    if "memory usage commands" in query.lower():
        return [query, "MEMORY USAGE", "MEMORY STATS", "MEMORY DOCTOR", "INFO memory"]
    # Add more expansions...
```

### 3. **Result Re-ranking**
```python
# Boost specific commands for command-related queries  
def boost_command_results(query: str, results: List) -> List:
    if "commands" in query.lower():
        # Boost results with uppercase command names
        # Penalize overly general "administration" results
```

This triage reveals the knowledge base is **fundamentally strong** (MRR=0.821) but has **specific gaps** that can be addressed through targeted improvements rather than systemic changes.

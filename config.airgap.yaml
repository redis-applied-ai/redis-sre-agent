# Redis SRE Agent Configuration - Air-Gapped Deployment
#
# This configuration is designed for air-gapped environments where:
# - No internet access is available
# - MCP servers using npx (like GitHub) are disabled
# - Only pre-installed MCP servers are enabled
#
# Copy this file to config.yaml in your deployment directory.

# MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers configuration
# Only servers that work without internet access are enabled
mcp_servers:
  # Memory server for long-term agent memory
  # Pre-installed in the air-gap image via uv tool install

      get_current_datetime:
        description: |
          Get the current date and time. Use this when you need to
          record timestamps for Redis instance events or incidents.

      create_long_term_memories:
        description: |
          Save long-term memories about Redis instances. Use this to
          record: past incidents and their resolutions, configuration
          changes, performance baselines, known issues, maintenance
          history, and lessons learned. Always include the instance_id
          in the memory text for future retrieval.

          {original}
      search_long_term_memory:
        description: |
          Search saved memories about Redis instances. ALWAYS use this
          before troubleshooting a Redis instance to recall past issues,
          solutions, and context. Search by instance_id, error patterns,
          or symptoms.

      get_long_term_memory:
        description: |
          Retrieve a specific memory by ID. Use this to get full details
          of a memory found via search.

          {original}
      edit_long_term_memory:
        description: |
          Update an existing memory. Use this to add new information to
          a past incident record, update resolution status, or correct
          outdated information.

          {original}
      delete_long_term_memories:
        description: |
          Delete memories that are no longer relevant. Use sparingly -
          prefer editing to add context rather than deleting.

  # GitHub MCP server - DISABLED for air-gap (requires npx/internet)
  # Uncomment and configure if you have an internal GitHub Enterprise
  # with HTTP-based MCP server available
  # github:
  #   url: http://your-internal-github-mcp:8080
  #   transport: streamable_http

# To add custom HTTP-based MCP servers pointing to internal endpoints:
# mcp_servers:
#   internal-tools:
#     url: http://your-internal-mcp-server:8080
#     transport: streamable_http

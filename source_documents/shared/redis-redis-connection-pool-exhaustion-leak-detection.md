# Redis Connection Pool Exhaustion Leak Detection

**Category**: shared
**Severity**: warning
**Source**: Generated runbook for Redis SRE Agent

## Symptoms
- Application experiencing delays or hanging due to inability to acquire new Redis connections.
- Redis server logs showing high number of connections.
- Connection pool metrics indicating maximum pool size reached.
- Increased latency in Redis operations.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Check Current Connections
```bash
redis-cli CLIENT LIST
# Look for a high number of connections with long 'age' and 'idle' times.
# Identify if connections are not being released back to the pool.
```

### 2. Analyze Application Logs
```bash
# Review application logs for connection pool usage patterns.
# Look for errors or warnings related to connection acquisition or release.
```

## Immediate Remediation

### Option 1: Restart Application
```bash
# Restart the application to release all connections.
# Warning: This may cause temporary downtime or service disruption.
```

### Option 2: Increase Connection Pool Size Temporarily
1. Access the application configuration.
2. Increase the maximum connection pool size.
3. Restart the application to apply changes.
4. Monitor the application to ensure stability.

## Long-term Prevention

### 1. Optimize Connection Pooling
- Ensure the application uses a connection pooling library that supports automatic connection release.
- Set a reasonable maximum pool size based on application load and Redis server capacity.

### 2. Set Connection Timeouts
- Configure connection timeouts to close idle connections:
  ```bash
  # Example configuration for a connection pooling library
  maxIdleTime=30000 # 30 seconds
  ```
- Implement logic to handle connection timeouts gracefully in the application.

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Track
```bash
# Monitor the number of active connections:
redis-cli INFO clients | grep connected_clients

# Monitor connection pool usage in the application:
# Use application-specific monitoring tools to track pool metrics.
```

### Alert Thresholds
- Alert if `connected_clients` exceeds 80% of the Redis server's maximum connection limit.
- Alert if application connection pool usage consistently exceeds 90% of its maximum size.

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Verify connection pooling library supports automatic connection release.
- [ ] Configure and test connection timeouts in a staging environment.
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for Redis connection metrics.
- [ ] Document application-specific connection pool configurations and limits.

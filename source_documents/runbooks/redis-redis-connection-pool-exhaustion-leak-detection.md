# Redis Connection Pool Exhaustion Leak Detection

**Category**: operational_runbook  
**Severity**: warning  
**Source**: Generated runbook for Redis SRE Agent

## Symptoms
- Applications hanging on Redis operations
- Errors such as "Pool exhausted" or "Unable to get connection"
- Increasing number of connections without corresponding releases
- High latency in Redis operations

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Check Current Connections
```bash
redis-cli CLIENT LIST
# Look for a high number of connections with long 'age' and 'idle' times.
# Identify connections that are not being released properly.
```

### 2. Analyze Application Logs
```bash
# Check application logs for errors related to connection pool exhaustion.
# Look for patterns or specific operations that might be causing leaks.
```

## Immediate Remediation

### Option 1: Restart Application Services
```bash
# Restart the application services to release all connections.
# WARNING: This is a temporary fix and may cause a brief downtime.
```

### Option 2: Increase Connection Pool Size
1. Identify the current pool size in your application configuration.
2. Increase the pool size temporarily to accommodate more connections.
3. Monitor the application to ensure stability.

## Long-term Prevention

### 1. Implement Connection Lifecycle Management
- Ensure that connections are properly closed after use.
- Use connection pooling libraries that support automatic connection release.

### 2. Set Connection Timeouts
- Configure connection timeouts to automatically close idle connections.
- Example configuration for a Redis client:
  ```yaml
  connectionTimeout: 2000
  idleTimeout: 30000
  ```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Track
```bash
# Monitor the number of active connections:
redis-cli INFO clients | grep connected_clients
# Track the number of rejected connections:
redis-cli INFO stats | grep rejected_connections
```

### Alert Thresholds
- Alert if `connected_clients` exceeds 80% of the pool size.
- Alert if `rejected_connections` increases significantly over a short period.

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Verify that all application components are using the correct connection pool settings.
- [ ] Ensure that connection timeouts are configured and tested.
- [ ] Implement automated alerts for connection pool metrics.
- [ ] Conduct regular reviews of application logs for connection-related errors.
